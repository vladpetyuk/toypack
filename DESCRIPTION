Description: Toy Package for Testing Package Installation on Fresh Computers.
            At this point there issues have been discovered in installation
            of some R/Bioconductor packages such as "DO.db", "GO.db", 
            "org.Ce.eg.db", "org.Hs.eg.db" and "reactome.db". The fact that
            some of the used LaTeX packages are missing also results in error
            during vignette compilation.
